          If the tensor is a scalar of non-boolean type, the scalar is converted to a boolean according to the
          following rule:
          if the scalar is a numerical value, non-zero means True and zero means False;
          if the scalar is a string, non-empty means True and empty means False.
          If the tensor is not a scalar, being empty means False and being non-empty means True.
